# 🐛 Bug Simulator 2026 (Ultimate Control Edition)

Welcome to the most frustratingly realistic development simulator ever made. In this game, your goal is to collect "BUGS" (red squares) while fighting against a system that is actively falling apart.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Launch**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2.  **Initialize**: Click the "INITIALIZE SYSTEM" button to start.
3.  **Collect**: Move your character (green square) to touch the red BUG squares.
4.  **Level Up**: Collect 5 bugs to progress to the next level.
5.  **Survive**: Keep your "STABILITY" above 0% or suffer a total system crash (BSOD).

### Controls
*   **Mouse**: Your character follows your cursor (with intentional driver lag).
*   **Keyboard**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or `Arrow Keys` for manual override.
*   **Reboot**: Press `R` or click the button on the crash screen to restart.

## 🛠️ Features (Known Bugs)
This game is intentionally broken to simulate a bad software launch:
*   **Input Latency**: High-fidelity mouse lag and keyboard buffer overflows.
*   **Kernel Panic**: Randomly switches between "STABLE" and "CHAOS" modes.
*   **Memory Corruption**: 20% chance your score resets upon collecting a bug.
*   **Physics Desync**: Random drift and coordinate inversions.
*   **Visual Glitches**: Screen shaking, flickering, and ghost pointers.
